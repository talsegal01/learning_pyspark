    "Last week we saw a number of design patterns in Hadoop MapReduce. This week we will look at the limitations of Hadoop MapReduce when it comes to running iterative jobs and preview the advantages of modern distributed compuation frameworks like Spark. By abstracting away many of the parallelization details Spark provides a flexible interface for the programmer. However a word of warning: don't let the ease of implementation lull you into complacency, scalable solutions still require attention to the details of smart algorithm design. \n",
    "\n",
    "In class today we'll get some practice working with Spark RDDS. We'll use Spark to re-implement each of the tasks that you performed using the Command Line or Hadoop Streaming in weeks 1-3 of the course. Our goal is to get you up to speed and coding in Spark as quickly as possible; this is by no means a comprehensive tutorial. By the end of today's demo you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __initialize__ a `SparkSession` in a local NB and use it to run a Spark Job.\n",
    "* ... __access__ the Spark Job Tracker UI.\n",
    "* ... __describe__ and __create__ RDDs from files or local Python objects.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the difference between actions and transformations.\n",
    "* ... __decide__ when to `cache` or `broadcast` part of your data.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ Word Counting, Sorting and Naive Bayes in Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE:`__ Although RDD successor datatype, Spark dataframes, are becoming more common in production settings we've made a deliberate choice to teach you RDDs first beause building homegrown algorithm implementations is crucial to developing a deep understanding of machine learning and parallelization concepts -- which is the goal of this course. We'll still touch on dataframes in Week 5 when talking about Spark efficiency considerations and we'll do a deep dive into Spark dataframes and streaming solutions in Week 12.\n",

    "In exercise 2 you saw how Spark builds an execution plan (DAG) so that transformations are evaluated lazily when triggerd by an action. In more complex DAGs you may need to reuse the contents of an RDD for multiple downstream operations. In such cases we'd like to avoid duplicating the computation of that intermediate result. Spark offers a few different options to persist an RDD in memory on the executor node where it is stored. Of these the most common is `cache()` (you'll read about others next week in ch 5 from _High Performance Spark_). Lets briefly look at how to `cache()` an RDD and discus when doing so is to your advantage."
